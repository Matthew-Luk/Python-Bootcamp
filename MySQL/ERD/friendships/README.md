For this assignment we had to create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users and their friends.
Each user should have an id, first_name, last_name, created_at and updated_at. Create a self join relationship (many to many to same table), where a user can have a friend (another user from the same table). Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
