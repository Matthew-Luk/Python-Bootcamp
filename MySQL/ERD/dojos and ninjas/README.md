For this assignment we had to create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks dojos, as well as the ninjas that belong to each dojo location.
Each dojo should have an id, name, created_at and updated_at; each ninja should have an id, first_name, last_name, age, created_at, updated_at and belong to a specific dojo. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
